# TCH-Application
<br />
This app was a rewrite of my previous app which are no longer worked on due to there are official apps for the famous YouTube channels which are protected by copy rights.  This application was a rewrite of another popular channel / group of channels to learn new development techniques in a realistic way for Android apps. 
<br/>
This project was abandoned when I joined Vinimaya to spend my time learning the Spring framework and other development practices I use within the work place that I did not know. I would like to go back in revisit some of these technologies such as RxJava.
