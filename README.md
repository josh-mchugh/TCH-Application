# TCH-Application
<br />
This application was not created for an monetary purpose. The sole creation of this application was continue learning about Android in a more realistic way them most examples and tutorials express on the internet. This application makes use of the YouTube Server's and content of a YouTube group called "The Creature Hub". With that in mind the objective of this application was to create an application similar to YouTube's in the sense you are able to watch YouTube videos. Of course there are many YouTube content creators and figured it would be wise to create a small application which revolves around a smaller group of content creators. 

Currently I have made use of a lot of YouTube APIs my goal is to decouple those into my own APIs which will give me more of a learning experiance such as my own Retrofit calls to the YouTube's server and experiance creating my own Media Player.
